# Toxic Comment Classification with Transformers
Incivility and toxic comments are pervasive issues in the age of the Internet, where users can post anonymously without fear of consequences. Manual filtering of such comments is time-consuming and impractical for many platforms. This project addresses this problem by employing sentiment analysis on a toxic comment dataset to determine the toxicity level of comments. Three classification models, namely Na√Øve Bayes, Transformer, and BERT, are evaluated and compared using a toxic comment dataset. The results demonstrate that all three models perform well in classifying toxic comments, with the BERT model yielding the most optimal results. The aim of this project is to create a safe online environment by enabling platforms to detect and remove toxic comments.
